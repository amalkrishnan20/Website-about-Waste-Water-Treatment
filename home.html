                <p>Wastewater treatment is a process which removes and eliminates contaminants from wastewater and converts this 
                    into an effluent that can be returned to the water cycle. Once returned to the water cycle, the effluent creates 
                    an acceptable impact on the environment or is reused for various purposes (called water reclamation). The treatment 
                    process takes place in a wastewater treatment plant. There are several kinds of wastewater which are treated at the 
                    appropriate type of wastewater treatment plant. For domestic wastewater (also called municipal wastewater or sewage), 
                    the treatment plant is called a Sewage Treatment. For industrial wastewater, treatment either takes place in a 
                    separate Industrial wastewater treatment, or in a sewage treatment plant (usually after some form of pre-treatment). 
                    Further types of wastewater treatment plants include Agricultural wastewater treatment and leachate treatment plants.

            <p>Processes commonly used in wastewater treatment include phase separation (such as sedimentation), biological and 
                chemical processes (such as oxidation) or polishing. The main by-product from wastewater treatment plants is a 
                type of sludge that is usually treated in the same or another wastewater treatment plant.Biogas can be another 
                by-product if anaerobic treatment processes are used. Treated wastewater can be reused as reclaimed water. 
                The main purpose of wastewater treatment is for the treated wastewater to be able to be disposed or reused safely. 
                However, before it is treated, the options for disposal or reuse must be considered so the correct treatment 
                process is used on the wastewater. Bangladesh has officially inaugurated the largest single sewage treatment 
                plant (STP) in South Asia, located in the Khilgaon area of the city. With a capacity to treat 
                five million sewage per day, the STP marks a significant step towards addressing the country's wastewater 
                management challenges
