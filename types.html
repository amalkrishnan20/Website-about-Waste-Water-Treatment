            <h2>SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS</h2>
            <div class="inline-img">
                <p>Sewage treatment (or domestic wastewater treatment, municipal wastewater treatment) 
                    is a type of wastewater treatment which aims to remove contaminants from sewage to produce an 
                    effluent that is suitable to discharge to the surrounding environment or an intended reuse application, 
                    thereby preventing water pollution from raw sewage discharges. Sewage contains wastewater from households 
                    and businesses and possibly pre-treated industrial wastewater. There are a high number of sewage treatment 
                    processes to choose from. These can range from decentralized systems (including on-site treatment systems) 
                    to large centralized systems involving a network of pipes and pump stations (called sewerage) which convey the 
                    sewage to a treatment plant. For cities that have a combined sewer, the sewers will also carry urban runoff 
                    (stormwater) to the sewage treatment plant. 
                </p>

            </div>
            <p>Sewage treatment often involves two main stages, called primary and secondary treatment, while advanced treatment also 
                incorporates a tertiary treatment stage with polishing processes and nutrient removal. Secondary treatment can reduce 
                organic matter (measured as biological oxygen demand) from sewage, using aerobic or anaerobic biological processes.
                At the global level, an estimated 52% of sewage is treated. However, sewage treatment rates are highly 
                unequal for different countries around the world. For example, while high-income countries treat approximately 
                74% of their sewage, developing countries treat an average of just 4.2%.

            <h2>INDUSTRIAL WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS</h2>
            <div class="inline-img">
                <p>Industrial wastewater treatment describes the processes used for treating wastewater that is produced by 
                    industries as an undesirable by-product. After treatment, the treated industrial wastewater (or effluent) 
                    may be reused or released to a sanitary sewer or to a surface water in the environment. Some industrial 
                    facilities generate wastewater that can be treated in sewage treatment plants. Most industrial processes, 
                    such as petroleum refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants have their own specialized facilities 
                    to treat their wastewaters so that the pollutant concentrations in the treated wastewater comply with the 
                    regulations regarding disposal of wastewaters into sewers or into rivers, lakes or oceans.This applies to 
                    industries that generate wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter (e.g. oil and grease), toxic 
                    pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, volatile organic compounds) or nutrients such as ammonia. 
                </p>

            </div>
            <p>Some industries install a pre-treatment system to remove some pollutants (e.g., toxic compounds), and then discharge 
                the partially treated wastewater to the municipal sewer system.
                Most industries produce some wastewater. Recent trends have been to minimize such production or to recycle 
                treated wastewater within the production process. Some industries have been successful at redesigning their 
                manufacturing processes to reduce or eliminate pollutants. Sources of industrial wastewater include battery 
                manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, electric power plants, food industry, iron and steel industry, metal 
                working, mines and quarries, nuclear industry, oil and gas extraction, petroleum refining and petrochemicals, 
                pharmaceutical manufacturing, pulp and paper industry, smelters, textile mills, industrial oil contamination, 
                water treatment and wood preserving. Treatment processes include brine treatment, solids removal (e.g. chemical 
                precipitation, filtration), oils and grease removal, removal of biodegradable organics, removal of other organics, 
                removal of acids and alkalis, and removal of toxic materials.

            <h2>AGRICULTURAL WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS</h2>
            <div class="inline-img">
                <p>Agricultural wastewater treatment is a farm management agenda for controlling pollution from confined animal 
                    operations and from surface runoff that may be contaminated by chemicals in fertilizer, pesticides, animal 
                    slurry, crop residues or irrigation water. Agricultural wastewater treatment is required for continuous 
                    confined animal operations like milk and egg production. It may be performed in plants using mechanized 
                    treatment units similar to those used for industrial wastewater. Where land is available for ponds, settling 
                    basins and facultative lagoons may have lower operational costs for seasonal use conditions from breeding 
                    or harvest cycles. Animal slurries are usually treated by containment in anaerobic lagoons before disposal 
                    by spray or trickle application to grassland. Constructed wetlands are sometimes used to facilitate treatment 
                    of animal wastes.

            <p>Nonpoint source pollution includes sediment runoff, nutrient runoff and pesticides. Point source pollution 
                includes animal wastes, silage liquor, milking parlour (dairy farming) wastes, slaughtering waste, vegetable 
                washing water and firewater. Many farms generate nonpoint source pollution from surface runoff which is not 
                controlled through a treatment plant.
